# Running the App
After you `cd` into the root folder, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, followed by `npm start` to run the app.

You can now test the log in page by creating an account and logging in.

To test other API routes, first log in and open the console on the home page. Then follow the instructions in `src/components/nutritionReport/nutritionReport.tsx` starting at line 67. You also want to open MongoDB cloud to keep track of the database changes.
